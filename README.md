# matrix-multiplication
In this project which was part of CS3310 -Design and Analysis of Algorithms: 

I examined the running time of the following 3 algorithms for performing matrix  multiplication and compared them to their theorical time complexity estimation.

1 - Iterative multiplication
2 - Divide and Conquer algoithm
3 - Strassen algorithm
